    <p>
      In 2019, I started investing and quickly realized that tracking my investments through excel sheets was not enough to fulfill my needs. I wanted access to more detailed stock data and the ability to group all my asset classes in one place. This is when I had the idea of creating a portfolio rebalancing app. I spent over a year developing the concept and design and initially started writing the backend in PHP, as it was the only backend language I knew. I used Vuejs for the frontend. As I continued working on the project, I decided to bring it to the next level and teamed up with a business partner. He improve the backend, which was re-written in Java. This allowed me to focus more on my strengths in design and frontend development.
